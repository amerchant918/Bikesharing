# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
To analyze the investment potential in Des Moines we analyze a few factors that help us understand the correlation between NY and Des Moines. We take a look at how many McDonald's are in New York versus Des Moines and their locations and some of the statistics of the population of Des Moines. All this information will be displayed in our [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ali.merchant5475#!/vizhome/NYCCitiBikeDashboard_15992818390860/BikeSharinginDesMoines?publish=yes).

## McDonald's in New York City versus Des Moines
There are 11 McDonalds in New York City but there are also 11 McDonalds in the city of Des Moines. This doesn't tell us much so let's drill down by looking at the next page in our story "Top Starting Locations with McDonalds".

### Does this affect where people go in the city
According to our Tableau story the top starting and ending locations are not around McDonalds. This intrigues us to question if McDonalds is not a landmark that has any correlation to the success of Citi Bikes in New York then what is?
Majority of the Citi bike locations are in Manhattan near parks and busy office areas. However if we take a look at https://www.catchdesmoines.com/things-to-do/walk-and-bike-tours/ we can see that there are planned bike tours. Also browsing on the same site we realize that there are many parks and downtown areas. 

### Overall demographics and statistics 
The last page in the Tableau story illustrates the size difference between New York and Des Moines. Although New York is a larger and denser city, Des Moines is an upcoming city with growing population and attractions. Based off our analysis where there are attractions the bikes will be high in demand in order for tourist to travel conveniently.
